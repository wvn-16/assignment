Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Introduction
The purpose of this EDA is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset in order to understand its properties and characteristics. This analysis will help to identify;
any missing values
outliers
trends and patterns in the data
as well as to generate hypotheses for further investigation.


Data
The dataset used for this EDA includes ["C:\Users\user\Downloads\insurance.csv"]. It contains [1338 rows x 7 columns]] and the variables include;
[(['age',
'sex',
'bmi', 
'children',
'smoker',
'region',
'charges'], 
dtype='object')].

Requirements
The following packages are required to run this EDA:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

Methodology

The EDA was performed in the following steps:


Data loading and cleaning

Univariate analysis

Bivariate analysis

Multivariate analysis

Model building (optional)


Results

The findings of the EDA can be found in the Jupyter Notebook ["C:\Users\user\Downloads\explotary data analysis assignment.ipynb"]. 


Conclusion

In conclusion, this EDA has provided a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and its properties. Further investigation is required to validate the findings and generate more concrete insights.






Logistic Regression


Introduction
This project aims to build a logistic regression model for [bank churn data]. Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome.

Data

The dataset used for this project includes ["C:\Users\user\Downloads\Bank EDA and logistic regression to predict churning.ipynb"]. It contains [10000 rows, 14columns] 


Requirements


The following packages are required to run this project:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn



Methodology

The following steps were taken in building the logistic regression model:


Data loading and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Preprocessing

Model building and evaluation

Hyperparameter tuning (optional)



Results
The findings of the project can be found in the Jupyter Notebook ["C:\Users\user\Downloads\Bank EDA and logistic regression to predict churning.ipynb"]. The model  accuracy  on the test data can be determined by more exhaustive functions on the dataset.


Conclusion

In conclusion, the logistic regression model was able to effectively solve the problem statement and provide valuable insights. Further improvements can be made by trying other models or performing feature engineering.
